This repository contains the data and code used for a comprehensive study of the evolution of deep learning models in open source repositories

 **How Do Deep Learning Models Evolve? 
 A Comprehensive Study of the Evolution of Deep Learning Models in OpenSource Repositories**
 
**Indexes**

1. **Data:** Contains all categories for 802 APIs and studied hyper-parameters. Also, list of all projects.
   * API Types: Contains all API to layer, training, convolutional APIs grouped by padding mode.
   * Parameter Types: Contains all common parameters, default-parameters studied, and other parameter types foor other layers studied.


2. **Results:** Contains all results structured RQ-wise, i.e., RQ2 folder contains raw change data for hyper-parameters, Timed Evolution ... contains data for 265 projects selected for timed evolution, also include default parameter analysis data and tunable parameter analysis data.


3. **Source Code:** Contains all Boa queries and Python analysis scripts organized by RQ.
